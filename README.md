# Metatrader4-RSI-Ichimoku-TraderBot
Automatic trader robot for metatrader 4 based on RSI 14 and Ichimoku Kumo

The detailed statement that has been uploaded has been done with no exclusion of financial securities based on spread.
I mean that in the actual deployed code to this repository, no trade is opened if the current spread is superior to 0.00015.
The test has been done without that spread test.
The actual code opens positions of 0.05 lots.
The robot analyzes all the financial securities that are in the Market watch window of Metatrader 4.

IF YOU USE THIS, YOU MUST KEEP AN EYE CONSTANTLY ON YOUR TRADE POSITIONS.
IF THE TRADE SEEMS NOT GOOD THEN YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF IT OR PLACE A UNCONDITIONAL STOP LOSS LEVEL.

HAVE FUN !
